    "## Looking Back\n",
    "\n",
    "When this year started, I was still finding my rhythm as a programmer. I could write functional code, but I often stayed within the boundaries of the assignment. I didn’t fully understand how to connect ideas into a working system—or how much creativity computer science actually allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "That changed fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the **Analytics Dashboard**, **GlucoQuest**, and **Camping Website**, I learned how to manage full projects from start to finish. These weren’t small tasks; they each required combining logic, structure, and design into something that actually worked and looked professional. I learned how to plan, test, break, and rebuild—and more importantly, how to trust myself through that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I used to think “getting it to run” was the goal. Now, I see that the real challenge is building projects that make sense, feel intuitive, and tell a story through data and interaction. Each project helped me grow—not just in coding skill, but in patience, communication, and attention to detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Want to Do Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the **Analytics and Certificate System** is running smoothly—tracking progress, generating insights, and creating certificates—it’s time to make it more *human*. I don’t just want it to show data; I want it to inspire users to keep learning and collaborating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s where I want to take it next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation and Milestones**  \n",
    "  I plan to create a lightweight motivational system that celebrates effort, not just results. Users would earn badges, streaks, or encouraging messages as they progress. It’s about turning analytics into something personal—where every small step feels like progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Peer Review and Community Features**  \n",
    "  I want to build a peer review hub where users can give feedback on each other’s work, share reflections, or highlight creative approaches. This would make the platform feel like a real learning community, not just a tracking tool. It encourages collaboration, accountability, and confidence through shared experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these updates would make the platform less like a report card and more like a mentorship space—driven by encouragement and shared growth.\n",

    "# Analytics Review: \n",
    "I made a significant amount of contributions across the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit Graph – Development Activity\n",
    "My commit frequency shows consistent contributions over time, particularly during development and integration phases of the project.\n",
    "The peaks align with integration, and testing cycles for the Code Runner and orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Want to Learn Next\n",
    "\n",
    "This year helped me realize that I love the connection between **data, design, and behavior**. I want to dig deeper into how systems can *understand* users, not just display their information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I want to focus on:\n",
    "- **AI Integration** – Using AI to generate insights, summaries, or smart recommendations within platforms.  \n",
    "- **Data Analytics and Visualization** – Turning complex data into clear, beautiful stories people can actually learn from.  \n",
    "- **Backend Efficiency** – Improving how data flows and scales as projects grow.  \n",
    "- **Human-AI Collaboration** – Designing systems that feel supportive and adaptive, not robotic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning these skills will help me create technology that does more than track progress—it *guides* it.\n",

    "## Reflection Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, I grew from following instructions to following my own ideas. I’ve learned that confidence doesn’t come from avoiding mistakes—it comes from solving them and moving forward with clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also realized that I sometimes want to build everything at once. I love exploring new technologies and ideas, but next year I want to focus on doing fewer things, better—giving each project the time to become something I’m truly proud of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every challenge this year taught me something different: how to think critically, communicate visually, and turn goals into finished products. More than anything, I’ve learned that growth isn’t about perfection—it’s about consistency, curiosity, and courage.\n",
