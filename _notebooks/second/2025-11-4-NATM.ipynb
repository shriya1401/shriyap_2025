    "\n",
    "Night at the Museum (N@tM) was a chance for us to share everything we’ve built and learned this trimester with teachers, families, and visitors. My group showcased our **Computer Science Portfolio Project**, which helps students build organized, interactive pages that highlight their coding progress, creativity, and growth. Our goal was to show that coding isn’t just about syntax—it’s about how you document, analyze, and communicate your process like a real developer.  \n",

    "## Presenting to Parents and Guests  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the showcase, I explained how each module in our portfolio connects to real learning outcomes—like mastering frontend tools, backend logic, and AI-based analytics. Visitors were especially interested in how the portfolio automatically tracks analytics and generates certificates for completed modules. I also talked about how this system motivates students to reflect on their progress rather than just turn in assignments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Parents asked really thoughtful questions about how the platform could be used in other subjects or for college portfolios. A few even mentioned how they liked that it helps students build confidence in presenting technical work in a creative and polished way.  \n",

    "## Feedback and Interaction  \n",
    "\n",
    "After our presentation, I walked around and explored other teams’ projects—everything from AI demos to data visualizations. Giving feedback helped me appreciate how every group took a different approach to solving problems. It also gave me new ideas for how to make our own analytics dashboard and certificate system more interactive. I realized that presenting isn’t just about showing your work—it’s about learning from how others communicate theirs.  \n",

    "\n",
    "N@tM was a meaningful and motivating experience because it reminded me that computer science is about more than just writing code—it’s about sharing ideas and impact. Seeing people genuinely interested in our project made me proud of the effort we put into design, teamwork, and presentation. I left the event inspired to keep improving our portfolio platform and to continue connecting technology with creativity and storytelling.  \n",
