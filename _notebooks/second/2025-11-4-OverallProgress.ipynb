    "# Trimester Reflection – Contributions and Achievements  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester, I focused on expanding both the technical and functional parts of our Computer Science portfolio system. My main goals were to improve automation, make learning tools more interactive, and help the team streamline grading and module organization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From designing a **personalized certificate system** to building **multi-level games** and coordinating the **grading infrastructure**, my work contributed to making the overall course experience more seamless and rewarding for both students and teachers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Certificate Generation Module  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 30px 0;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/certificates.png\" alt=\"Certificate Module Interface\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25); margin-bottom: 20px;\" />\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/certif.png\" alt=\"Generated Certificate Example\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my biggest accomplishments was developing the **Certificate Generation Module**. This feature allows students to download personalized certificates for each completed module. When users click “Download,” the system automatically inserts their name, module title, and date — transforming raw analytics data into a polished, shareable certificate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This module helped me strengthen my understanding of backend automation, file generation, and how to connect user data dynamically to front-end design elements. The result is a smooth, rewarding user experience that makes progress more tangible and motivating.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Breakout Game and Checkpoints  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 30px 0;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/game.png\" alt=\"Breakout Game Project\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25); margin-bottom: 20px;\" />\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/checkpoint.png\" alt=\"Checkpoint Questions Interface\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "I also worked on creating and customizing a **multi-level Breakout Game**, where each level introduces new layouts and increasing difficulty. I implemented progression logic with a “Next Level” button and checkpoint saving so players could resume from their last stage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the game, I developed the **lesson checkpoints** — interactive quizzes that assess understanding after each coding milestone. These use JavaScript logic and dynamic feedback to simulate a guided learning experience that blends gameplay and education.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project helped me refine my skills in UI design, logic-based interactivity, and user progress tracking while keeping the experience engaging and modular.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Setup and Grading System  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 30px 0;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/grading.png\" alt=\"Lesson and Grading Spreadsheet\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25); margin-bottom: 20px;\" />\n",
    "  <img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/grades.png\" alt=\"Student Progress Data Visualization\" width=\"80%\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond coding, I played a key role in organizing and finalizing the **lesson structure and grading spreadsheets** used throughout the trimester. Our team mapped each assignment to its lesson ID, rubric, and weight to ensure consistent scoring and transparent progress tracking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I helped finalize the grading logic, debug data discrepancies, and verify checkpoint alignment across modules. This made it easier for both teachers and students to monitor progress in real time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Contributing to this process taught me the importance of collaboration and precision — ensuring that our systems didn’t just function, but worked reliably at scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection  \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back, this trimester helped me grow not just as a programmer but as a developer who values usability, clarity, and real-world application. The **certificate module** taught me automation and dynamic rendering; the **Breakout Game** taught me about user experience and structure; and the **grading system** taught me collaboration and accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these experiences strengthened my ability to take an idea from concept to completion — and gave me confidence in balancing technical depth with creative design and teamwork.  \n"
