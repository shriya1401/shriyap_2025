    "## Things I Learned\n",
    "- I learned how to analyze a problem by identifying how an object’s state changes over time rather than focusing only on return values.\n",
    "- I learned how constructors are used to initialize all instance variables so an object begins in a consistent and valid state.\n",
    "- I learned how to apply conditional logic carefully to ensure that state changes occur only under the correct conditions.\n",
    "- I learned how helper methods can simplify complex logic and make the main methods easier to read and debug.\n",
    "- I learned how to use flags or counters to control program flow and represent changing conditions within an object.\n",
    "- I learned how method calls can affect future behavior even when they do not directly return a value.\n",
    "- I learned how to trace execution step by step to confirm that each method call produces the expected outcome.\n",
    "- I learned how creating multiple objects from the same class results in independent instances with separate states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things I Struggled With\n",
    "- I struggled with determining exactly when state changes should occur versus when values should remain the same.\n",
    "- I struggled with structuring conditionals so that only the intended branch executes in each situation.\n",
    "- I struggled with recognizing how an early logic error could cause incorrect results later in the program.\n",
    "- I struggled with ensuring that all instance variables were properly updated and not unintentionally overwritten.\n",
    "- I struggled with tracing long sequences of method calls without losing track of the object’s current state.\n",
    "- I struggled with debugging because one incorrect condition often affected multiple outputs.\n",
    "- I struggled with fully understanding how object state persists across method calls.\n",
    "- I struggled with balancing clarity and conciseness while still meeting all the problem’s requirements."
