    "## A Few Things I Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- I learned how to use instance variables to track food levels across multiple days and maintain the object’s state throughout the simulation.  \n",
    "- I learned how conditional logic models different outcomes, such as birds eating daily or a bear visiting occasionally, and how those conditions affect the flow of the program.  \n",
    "- I learned how loops can simulate repeated events over time and allow the program to automatically update values day by day.  \n",
    "- I learned how helper methods allow complex simulations to be broken into manageable parts, making the code more organized and easier to debug.  \n",
    "- I learned how to think step-by-step when designing a simulation so that each event happens in the correct order.  \n",
    "- I learned how small changes in logic can significantly impact the final result of a program.  \n",
    "- I learned how to test edge cases, such as when food is almost gone, to ensure the simulation behaves correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## A Few Things I Struggled With\n",
    "\n",
    "- I struggled with knowing when to stop the simulation once food ran out and ensuring the loop condition reflected that correctly.  \n",
    "- I struggled with correctly updating the food amount after each day without accidentally subtracting too much or too little.  \n",
    "- I struggled with tracing how values changed inside a loop, especially when multiple conditions were involved.  \n",
    "- I struggled with small logic errors that affected the final day count, even when the code seemed mostly correct.  \n",
    "- I struggled with debugging because sometimes the output was slightly off, making it hard to identify exactly where the mistake occurred.  \n"
