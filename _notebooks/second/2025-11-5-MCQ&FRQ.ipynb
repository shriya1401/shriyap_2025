    "- **Selected**: `!a && !b || c`\n",
    "- **Correct Answer**: `!a || !b || c`\n",

    "- **Selected**: \"*\"  is printed  n  more times than  \"@\"\n",
    "- **Correct Answer**:  \"*\"  is printed  m  more times than  \"@\"\n",
    "- **Explanation**: There are  m * n  iterations of the loop in Code Segment 1. In Code Segment 2, the outer loop executes  m  times and the inner loop executes  n - 1  times for each iteration of the outer loop. There are  m * n - m  iterations of the inner loop in code segment 2, so  \"*\"  is printed  m  more times than  \"@\"  is printed.\n",

    "- **Correct Answer**:  The sum of all odd integers between  1  and  num,  inclusive\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The variable  loop  starts at  1  and increments by  2  for each iteration until it is greater than  num.  The values of  loop  that are being added together are the odd integers from  1  to  num  if  num  is odd or  1  to  num - 1  if  num  is even. In either case, these are the odd integers between  1  and  num.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Selected**: 10\n",
    "- **Correct Answer**: 7\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The loop control variable  k  is initially set to  0  and then incremented by  2  until  k  is greater than or equal to the length of the array. During the loop, the values of  k  are  0,  2,  4, and  6.  When  k  has the value  8,  the loop terminates since the length of  arr  is  7.  Prior to the loop,  x  is assigned  0  and then in the body of the loop, the value of  arr  at index  k  is added to  x.  In the first iteration of the loop, when  k  has the value  0,  arr[0]  (which is  3)  is added to the value of  x  and  x  is assigned  3.  In the second iteration of the loop,  when  k  has the value  2,  arr[2]  (which is  1)  is added to the value of  x  and  x  is assigned  4.  In the third iteration of the loop, when  k  has the value  4,  arr[4]  (which is  1)  is added to the value of  x  and  x  is assigned  5.  In the fourth and final iteration of the loop, when  k  has the value  6,  arr[6]  (which is  2)  is added to the value of  x  and  x  is assigned  7.\n",

    "   sum += k.getAge();\n",
    "   count++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The method uses an enhanced  for  loop, so  k  is a  StudentInfo  object representing an element in  studentList.  This code segment compares the string parameter  theMajor  with the string returned by  k.getMajor().  If the two strings are equal,  sum  is incremented by the value returned by  k.getAge()  and  count  is incremented by  1.\n",

    "{\n",
    "   maxPages = b.getPages();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The enhanced  for  loop traverses  bookList  and the loop control variable  b  is assigned  Book  objects. The  if  statement compares the value returned by the call  b.getPages()  to the current value of  maxPages.  If the returned value is greater than  maxPages,  maxPages  is updated with the new maximum value.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The outer loop iterates one fewer time than the length of the array. The inner loop is dependent on the outer loop, starting at the value of  j + 1  and iterating to the end of the array. On the first pass through the outer loop, the inner loop will iterate five times, meaning the  /* Compare values */  expression will execute 5 times. Each subsequent iteration will result in one fewer iteration of the inner loop. Therefore, the  /* Compare values */  expression is evaluated 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, or 15, times. The  /* Assign to temp */  expression is evaluated for every iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the assignment is made 5 times.\n",

    "## FRQ Patterns I’m Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all four FRQs, I repeatedly used these core patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random selection**: `(int)(Math.random() * n)`  \n",
    "- **String building in loops**: `+=` with consistent formatting  \n",
    "- **Substring searching**: `indexOf(str, start)` + careful index updates  \n",
    "- **State management**: multiple instance variables working together  \n",
    "- **Min/closest tracking**: keep “best-so-far” + update condition  \n",
    "- **2D traversal**: row loop outside, column loop inside  \n",
    "- **Row/sequence validation**: boolean flag + early `break`  \n",

    "\n",
    "## What I Did Well\n",
    "- I can read a prompt and quickly identify the required algorithm.\n",
    "- I can explain each solution in plain language before writing code.\n",
    "- I recognize common FRQ patterns (counting, searching, resetting, comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I Need to Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Java Syntax Fluency\n",
    "I need more repetition writing from memory:\n",
    "- method headers + return types  \n",
    "- for-loops and nested loops  \n",
    "- braces/indentation consistency  \n",
    "- common built-in calls (`Math.random`, `Math.abs`, `indexOf`, `.size()`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Speed + Confidence Under Pressure\n",
    "Even when I know the logic, I slow down because I:\n",
    "- second-guess small syntax details  \n",
    "- worry about missing parentheses/braces  \n",
    "- hesitate on loop boundaries and condition placement  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Make the structure automatic so the logic can show clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Write **full FRQ methods from scratch** (no copying) until syntax feels automatic  \n",
    "- Do timed practice focusing on:\n",
    "  - nested loops  \n",
    "  - state-tracking classes  \n",
    "  - substring searching with overlaps  \n",
    "- After each FRQ, check:\n",
    "  - loop boundaries  \n",
    "  - reset/order-of-operations  \n",
    "  - whether I returned the correct value (ID vs score, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** This set confirmed my logic is strong — my biggest improvement area is turning that logic into clean Java quickly and confidently.\n"
