    "## Dynamic Rate Limiting — Adaptive API Protection in Spring Boot\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester, I implemented a dynamic rate limiting system in the Spring Boot backend to protect APIs from abuse while maintaining fairness and scalability under varying load conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a static per-user request limit, I designed a system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracks active authenticated users  \n",
    "- Dynamically adjusts request limits based on system load  \n",
    "- Rebuilds user-specific token buckets when limits change  \n",
    "- Uses Bucket4j for in-memory token bucket enforcement  \n",
    "- Prevents abuse while scaling gracefully  \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is an adaptive rate limiter that balances protection and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 — The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are vulnerable to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brute-force login attempts  \n",
    "- API scraping  \n",
    "- Automated abuse  \n",
    "- Resource exhaustion under high load  \n",
    "\n",
    "A static rate limit (e.g., 20 requests per minute) has drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too restrictive when few users are active  \n",
    "- Too permissive during high traffic  \n",
    "- Does not scale with system load  \n",
    "\n",
    "We needed a smarter system that adjusts limits dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 — The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented a `RateLimitFilter` using Spring's `OncePerRequestFilter` and Bucket4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Component\n",
    "public class RateLimitFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executes once per HTTP request  \n",
    "- Identifies the user (or IP if unauthenticated)  \n",
    "- Computes a dynamic rate limit  \n",
    "- Applies token bucket enforcement  \n",
    "- Returns HTTP 429 when the limit is exceeded  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 — Core Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. User Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Each request is mapped to a unique key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String username = request.getUserPrincipal() != null\n",
    "        ? request.getUserPrincipal().getName()\n",
    "        : request.getRemoteAddr();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authenticated users are rate limited individually  \n",
    "- Unauthenticated users are rate limited by IP  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Active User Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticated users are tracked:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (request.getUserPrincipal() != null) {\n",
    "    activeUsers.put(username, true);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the system to compute limits based on real-time user load.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamic Limit Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a fixed limit, the system adjusts based on active users:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int computeDynamicLimit(String username, int activeUsers) {\n",
    "    if (activeUsers < 5) {\n",
    "        return 100;\n",
    "    } else if (activeUsers < 20) {\n",
    "        return 300;\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        return 600;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "| Active Users | Requests Per Minute |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| < 5         | 100                |\n",
    "| < 20        | 300                |\n",
    "| 20+         | 600                |\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generous limits when few users are online  \n",
    "- Higher aggregate throughput when system usage grows  \n",
    "- Adaptive scaling behavior  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4 — Token Bucket Implementation (Bucket4j)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user has their own bucket stored in a concurrent cache:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private final Map<String, Bucket> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n",
    "private final Map<String, Integer> userLimits = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a limit changes, the bucket is rebuilt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "cache.put(username, createBucketWithLimit(dynamicLimit));\n",
    "userLimits.put(username, dynamicLimit);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bucket Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private Bucket createBucketWithLimit(int limit) {\n",
    "    Bandwidth bandwidth = Bandwidth.builder()\n",
    "            .capacity(limit)\n",
    "            .refillGreedy(limit, Duration.ofMinutes(1))\n",
    "            .build();\n",
    "\n",
    "    return Bucket.builder()\n",
    "            .addLimit(bandwidth)\n",
    "            .build();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- `capacity(limit)` → Maximum tokens available  \n",
    "- `refillGreedy(limit, Duration.ofMinutes(1))` → Refill all tokens every minute  \n",
    "- `tryConsume(1)` → Consumes 1 token per request  \n",
    "\n",
    "If no tokens remain, the request is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 5 — Request Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "For every request:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify user or IP  \n",
    "2. Track active authenticated users  \n",
    "3. Compute dynamic limit  \n",
    "4. Rebuild bucket if limit changed  \n",
    "5. Attempt to consume 1 token  \n",
    "6. If allowed → continue request  \n",
    "7. If denied → return HTTP 429  \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (bucket.tryConsume(1)) {\n",
    "    filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    response.setStatus(429);\n",
    "    response.getWriter().write(\"Too many requests - limit: \" + dynamicLimit + \" per minute\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 6 — Why This Design Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread-Safe\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` for safe concurrent access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Per-User Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user/IP has their own independent bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "Limits adjust automatically as user load changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimal Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory token buckets are lightweight and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configurable Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "Default limit can be injected via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Value(\"${security.rate-limit.requests-per-minute:20}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows environment-based configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 7 — Security Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This rate limiter protects against:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brute force attacks  \n",
    "- API scraping  \n",
    "- Request flooding  \n",
    "- Denial-of-service style abuse  \n",
    "\n",
    "And it does so without punishing legitimate users during low-traffic periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Near-Term\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add sliding window tracking instead of greedy refill  \n",
    "- Track burst detection patterns  \n",
    "- Add logging for rate-limit violations  \n",
    "- Include `Retry-After` header  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Longer-Term\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting  \n",
    "- Separate limits per endpoint  \n",
    "- Role-based rate limits (admin vs student)  \n",
    "- Integration with anomaly detection system  \n",
    "- Dashboard for monitoring rate-limit metrics  \n",

    "\n",
    "Previously, FRQs were implemented as question-specific features. Each year or problem often had custom frontend layouts and inconsistent backend submission logic. This slowed development, created duplication, and made automation difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "- One reusable frontend layout  \n",
    "- A centralized backend submission pipeline  \n",
    "- Automated AI rubric grading  \n",
    "- Structured, persistent feedback storage  \n",

    "- Increased maintenance cost  \n",
    "- Risk of inconsistent student experience  \n",
    "- Difficulty integrating AI grading cleanly  \n",
