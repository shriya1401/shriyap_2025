    "## FRQ Unification : Standardizing AP CSA Free Response Across the Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This trimester, my work focused on eliminating fragmentation in how AP CSA Free Response Questions (FRQs) were authored, displayed, submitted, graded, and reviewed across the Open Coding Society platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, FRQs were implemented as question-specific features. Each year or problem often had custom frontend layouts and inconsistent backend submission logic. This slowed development, created duplication, and made automation difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution was to design and implement a **fully unified FRQ system** built around:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One reusable frontend layout  \n",
    "- A centralized backend submission pipeline  \n",
    "- Automated AI rubric grading  \n",
    "- Structured, persistent feedback storage  \n",
    "- Seamless integration with existing assignment and grading systems  \n",
    "\n",
    "This transformed FRQs from isolated pages into a standardized, extensible framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 — FRQ Fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "FRQs were previously implemented with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question-specific layouts  \n",
    "- Hardcoded rendering logic  \n",
    "- Inconsistent submission handling  \n",
    "- Disconnected grading workflows  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a new FRQ required touching multiple frontend and backend files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duplicate layout code  \n",
    "- Increased maintenance cost  \n",
    "- Risk of inconsistent student experience  \n",
    "- Difficulty integrating AI grading cleanly  \n",
    "\n",
    "The system lacked a single source of truth for FRQs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fix — Unified FRQ Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "I introduced a single reusable layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "_layouts/frq.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All FRQs now can use metadata-driven front matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "---\n",
    "layout: frq\n",
    "title: 2025 FRQ 2\n",
    "year: 2025\n",
    "frq_number: 2\n",
    "unit: Arrays\n",
    "category: Methods and Control Flow\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout dynamically renders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question metadata\n",
    "- Prompt content\n",
    "- Submission textarea\n",
    "- Submission + refresh logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- No hardcoded question IDs\n",
    "- No duplicated layout logic\n",
    "- All FRQs share the same rendering engine\n",
    "- Adding new FRQs requires only metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "This shifted FRQs from “custom pages” to structured content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 — Unified Submission & Grading Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before unification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submission handling varied across FRQs\n",
    "- Grading logic was not centralized\n",
    "- AI feedback lacked consistent structure\n",
    "- Submissions were not fully aligned with assignment systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevented clean automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fix — Centralized Submission Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "All FRQs now can follow a single submission pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 — Save Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /api/submissions/submit/{assignmentId}\n",

    "\n",
    "Creates a new `AssignmentSubmission` record.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 — Trigger AI Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /api/frq-feedback/submission/{submissionId}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sends student response to Gemini\n",
    "- Applies AP-style rubric evaluation\n",
    "- Generates structured feedback\n",
    "- Persists results to database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3 — Retrieve Updated Results\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /api/submissions/getSubmissions/{studentId}\n",

    "- Secure mapping between users and submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 — Structured Feedback & Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "AI grading output must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structured\n",
    "- Persistable\n",
    "- Queryable\n",
    "- Transparent\n",
    "- Future-proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing raw text responses would limit analytics and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Feedback is stored in a normalized format inside the `feedback` table.\n",

    "\n",
    "A core principle was **unification, not duplication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRQ system integrates directly with:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. AssignmentSubmission Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "FRQs are treated as standard assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Individual grading\n",
    "- Group submissions\n",
    "- Grade back-propagation\n",
    "- Dashboard integration\n",
    "\n",
    "No special-case logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Grade API\n",
    "\n",
    "Because FRQs persist as `AssignmentSubmission` records:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scores appear in grade dashboards\n",
    "- Exports work automatically\n",
    "- Analytics remain consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Gemini AI Feedback Service\n",
    "\n",
    "The unified layout connects directly to the Gemini grading service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-to-end flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontend → Submission API → Gemini → Structured Feedback → Persistence → Display\n",
