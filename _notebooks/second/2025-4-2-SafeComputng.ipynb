    "1. **Use a VPN:** Encrypts your traffic so hackers can’t read it, even on public Wi-Fi.  \n",
    "2. **Stick to HTTPS Sites:** Look for “https://” in the URL—it means the site encrypts your data.  \n",
    "3. **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:** Don’t access banking or enter passwords on public networks.  \n",
    "4. **Turn Off Sharing & Auto-Connect:** Disable file sharing and avoid auto-joining open networks.  \n",
    "5. **Use Two-Factor Authentication:** Adds a security layer even if your credentials get exposed.\n",
