    "# AP CSA FRQ Practice Set 2 — Review & Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers four AP Computer Science A Free Response Questions and what I learned from solving them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RobotMover** — random selection, string construction, substring searching (Parts A & B)  \n",
    "- **LapTracker** — full class design + state management across method calls  \n",
    "- **PlayerAnalysis** — ArrayList traversal + selecting the closest value  \n",
    "- **WordGrid** — 2D array traversal + row validation with adjacent comparisons  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reflection:** I understand the *logic* of these FRQs well (I can break down the prompt and plan the algorithm), but I still need more **Java syntax fluency** when writing complete solutions from memory. I used AI to help comment and clean up my code after I solved each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: RobotMover Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the FRQ tested\n",
    "- Random number generation with equal probability  \n",
    "- Building a formatted string inside a loop  \n",
    "- String searching (`indexOf`, `substring`)  \n",
    "- Correct loop boundaries + overlapping matches  \n",
    "- Preserving object state (no unintended changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The class stores one instance variable:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private String moveSequence;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatted like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "move_move_move_...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A — Constructor: `RobotMover(int numMoves)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create `numMoves` random moves, each followed by `\"_\"`, with equal chance of: `up, down, left, right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea:** generate an integer `0–3` and map it to one of four moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public RobotMover(int numMoves)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    moveSequence = \"\";\n",
    "\n",
    "    String[] moves = {\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\"};\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < numMoves; i++)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        int randIndex = (int)(Math.random() * 4);  // 0-3\n",
    "        moveSequence += moves[randIndex] + \"_\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** I understood the algorithm immediately, but I hesitated on the exact random-number syntax and string-building structure. More repetition writing constructors from scratch will help.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B — Method: `countOccurrences(String str)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Return how many times `str` appears in `moveSequence`, including **overlapping** matches (ex: `\"up_up\"` appears twice in `\"up_up_up_\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy:** Use `indexOf(str, startIndex)` and move forward by **1** each time to allow overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int countOccurrences(String str)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",
    "    int index = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "    while (true)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        int found = moveSequence.indexOf(str, index);\n",
    "\n",
    "        if (found == -1)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            break;\n",

    "\n",
    "        count++;\n",
    "        index = found + 1;  // move by 1 to allow overlapping matches\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return count;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** My logic was correct, but I needed to slow down and be precise with `indexOf` + loop control.\n",

    "## Question 2: LapTracker Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the FRQ tested\n",
    "- Designing a full class with correct instance variables  \n",
    "- Tracking state across multiple calls  \n",
    "- Reset logic based on method call count  \n",
    "- Correct *timing* of resets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core concept:** This is a **state-persistence** FRQ: the object must remember what happened across calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class LapTracker\n",

    "        callCount = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int addLaps(int laps)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // reset happens at the start of a new cycle\n",
    "        if (callCount == resetFrequency)\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            lapCount = 0;\n",
    "            callCount = 0;\n",
    "        }\n",

    "        return lapCount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** I understood what needed to be tracked (laps + call count), but I still second-guess *where* the reset should happen. For these FRQs, the order of operations matters as much as the idea.\n",

    "## Question 3: PlayerAnalysis — `playerWithClosestScore`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the FRQ tested\n",
    "- ArrayList traversal  \n",
    "- Tracking a “best-so-far” element  \n",
    "- Using `Math.abs()` for distance  \n",
    "- Returning associated data (player ID), not just the score  \n",
    "- Not modifying the list  \n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return closest.getID();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** My main weakness here is not the algorithm—it’s confidence with loop bounds and writing the “tracking two things” pattern quickly (closest object + best diff).\n",

    "## Question 4: WordGrid — `countOrderedRows`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the FRQ tested\n",
    "- 2D array traversal  \n",
    "- Adjacent comparisons within a row  \n",
    "- Boolean flag pattern (`assume true → invalidate if broken`)  \n",
    "- Early exit with `break`  \n",
    "- Correct indexing (start at col `1`, compare to `col - 1`)  \n",

    "    return count;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "# FRQ Patterns I’m Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all four FRQs, I repeatedly used these core patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random selection**: `(int)(Math.random() * n)`  \n",
    "- **String building in loops**: `+=` with consistent formatting  \n",
    "- **Substring searching**: `indexOf(str, start)` + careful index updates  \n",
    "- **State management**: multiple instance variables working together  \n",
    "- **Min/closest tracking**: keep “best-so-far” + update condition  \n",
    "- **2D traversal**: row loop outside, column loop inside  \n",
    "- **Row/sequence validation**: boolean flag + early `break`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# What I Did Well\n",
    "- I can read a prompt and quickly identify the required algorithm.\n",
    "- I can explain each solution in plain language before writing code.\n",
    "- I recognize common FRQ patterns (counting, searching, resetting, comparing).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What I Need to Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Java Syntax Fluency\n",
    "I need more repetition writing from memory:\n",
    "- method headers + return types  \n",
    "- for-loops and nested loops  \n",
    "- braces/indentation consistency  \n",
    "- common built-in calls (`Math.random`, `Math.abs`, `indexOf`, `.size()`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Speed + Confidence Under Pressure\n",
    "Even when I know the logic, I slow down because I:\n",
    "- second-guess small syntax details  \n",
    "- worry about missing parentheses/braces  \n",
    "- hesitate on loop boundaries and condition placement  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Make the structure automatic so the logic can show clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Next Steps\n",
    "- Write **full FRQ methods from scratch** (no copying) until syntax feels automatic  \n",
    "- Do timed practice focusing on:\n",
    "  - nested loops  \n",
    "  - state-tracking classes  \n",
    "  - substring searching with overlaps  \n",
    "- After each FRQ, check:\n",
    "  - loop boundaries  \n",
    "  - reset/order-of-operations  \n",
    "  - whether I returned the correct value (ID vs score, etc.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall:** This set confirmed my logic is strong — my biggest improvement area is turning that logic into clean Java quickly and confidently.\n"
