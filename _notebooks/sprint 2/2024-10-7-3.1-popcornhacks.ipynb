    "This second homework hack is a recipe ingrediant converter allowing the user to input ingredients with their quantities in one unit, ex : cups or tablespoons, and then convert them to another unit, ex : teaspoons. First, I set up a dictionary (conversionRates), then stored the values of conversions inside of them, with variables, 'cupsToTeaspoons: 48'. Then I used the convertingrediant function which takes the quantity, current unit, and wanted unit as input and performs the conversion based on the conversion rates given. They continously will get prompted by entering their ingrediants until they enter stop as shown 'while (true) {\n",
    "    let ingredientName = prompt(\"Enter the name of the ingredient (or type 'done' to finish):\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (ingredientName.toLowerCase() === \"done\") {\n",
    "        break; // Exit the loop if the user is done\n",
    "    } }'\n",
    "Then after the user enters done a summary of all the ingrediants will appear in the console,\n",
    " 'console.log(\"\\nConverted Ingredients Summary:\");\n",
    "ingredients.forEach(ingredient => {\n",
    "    console.log(`${ingredient.quantity} ${ingredient.currentUnit} of ${ingredient.name} is equal to ${ingredient.convertedQuantity?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'} ${ingredient.desiredUnit}.`);\n",
    "});'"
   ]
  }
